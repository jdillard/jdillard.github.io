In an attempt to mix things up, some friends and I decided to go on our first
sea kayaking adventure in the Salish Sea. We had all done our fair share of
other adventures before, but this was brand new territory and a chance to test
our abilities with the unknown.

## Itinerary

Our original plan was a 3 day trip that started on Lopez Island, used [Jones
Island State Park](https://parks.state.wa.us/525/Jones-Island) as a basecamp
instead, before ending back at Lopez Island.

For reasons I'll cover later, we ended up using [Turn Island Marine State Park](https://parks.state.wa.us/295/Turn-Island)
as a base camp instead, before heading back to Lopez Island. Even though it
wasn't the planned iternary it was still a lot of fun and a great learning
opportunity.

## Day 1 - Arrive at Lopez Island

We reserved the **9:35 AM** [ferry from Anacortes to Lopez Island](https://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Ferries/Schedule/ScheduleDetail.aspx?departingterm=1&arrivingterm=13&roundtrip=true), because [Lopez Kayaks](https://www.lopezkayaks.com)
didn't open until **9:00 AM** and we thought it would still allow us to time
the tides correctly. In hindsight, catching the **6:15 AM** ferry and using that
extra time to unload the gear and have it prepped would have given us the margin
of error that we needed.

Since there were three of us, we decided to do one double touring kayak and one
single, with a total of five dry bags between us. According to
[the 120&deg; Rule](https://www.gobair.org/Resources/Documents/Cold_Water.pdf)
we probably didn't need wetsuits, so we opted out, but the morning temps were
cutting it close so it might not have been a bad idea. Dry suites would have
obviously been ideal.

> **Pro Tip:** It would be a good idea to attend one of the [Washington Kayak Club Pool Sessions](https://wakayakclub.clubexpress.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=821680&module_id=137271)
to get first hand experience practicing rescue techniques before it really
matters. Between the water temperatures, speed of the currents, and weight of
the kayaks, it isn't that hard for things to go sideways out there.

We finally got the kayaks all geared up hit the water at **12:00 PM**, a bit
later than planned. Everything was going pretty smooth as we crossed the exposed
and windy San Juan Channel, until we neared Turn Point where we misjudged our
approach in the strong tides, causing us to almost get swept North East,
over into the middle of the San Juan Channel.

In what seemed like an eternity of fighting the tides and the wind, we finally
made it over to shore to gather ourselves. It was our first dose of reality,
having learned the hard way how to apply the tide charts we read on the internet
to how the tides interact with local land features.

We headed off again towards our destination, but shortly after a member of our
party started experiencing vertigo, so we pulled back over on land to take a
longer rest and discuss our options. We decided on heading back, but to look for
opporunities along the way just in case.

Luckily for us, we came across a mostly empty Turn Island Marine State Park and
were able to pick a prime camping spot right on the bay. Off in the distance
that night we could hear whales breaching as they migrated down the channel.

## Day 2 - Checking out Friday Harbor

Since we had planned on having running water avialable at our original campsite,
and Turn Island didn't provide that, we had to make a trek into Friday Harbor
the next day. We decided to wait until around lunch time so we could grab a bite
to eat and try to get closer to slack tide, but not so late that it was high
tide while we were there and our potential landing areas would be underwater.

The closer to Friday Harbor we got the more overwhelming it was due to the
scattered boats of all sizes, ferries coming to and from the harbor, and
sea planes landing and taking off with tourists. We carefully made it into to
dock and were able to enjoy some fresh coffee and food before doing some
shopping for beer, cheese, and sausage -- oh, and water.

We got back to camp where we were greeted by a large group of kayakers that
turned out to be members of the Washington Kayak Club. They could tell we were
beginners and gave us a bunch of helpful sea kayaking tips that made us a little
more confident.

Once night hit, one of the kayakers came over to tell us that if we were lucky
we might get a chance to see the bioluminescence in the bay. Sure enough, it
finally got dark enough and it turned out to be an incredible experience as we
splashed the water and sped our kayaks up and down the shorline as small glowing
waves formed off the bow of the kayak like a scene from Tron.

## Day 2 - Return to Lopez Island

We woke up early to pack up so that we could catch the slack tide back, which
worked out perfectly. Crossing the San Juan Channel when everything was dead
still and not a boat in sight was a completely different experience. We even had
some curious seals cruising around our kayaks and poking there little bald heads
up to keep an eye on us.

After returning the kayaks, we did some hiking and got in line early for the
ferry back, since there are only so many spots available on the return rige and
we were told it can get pretty backed up on the weekends.
